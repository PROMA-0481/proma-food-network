            <h1>About Chefs</h1>
            <p align="justify">Chefs are a part of one of the largest industries in the world, without whose presence
                the food industry
                would cease to exist. They are highly-skilled certified cooks, who are well-versed in all the facets of
                food planning and execution. Traditionally, chefs go through laborious training and have to be extremely
                passionate when it comes to their profession. Before ascending to the position of head chef, they
                originally start out as ‘sous-chefs’ or apprentices in the kitchen and slowly progress to executive chef
                and finally, head chef. One of the oldest documented professional chefs in the world was Guillaume
                Tirel, who was fondly known as ‘Taillevent’. From then on, there has been an explosion in the number of
                chefs around the world, all working towards making the food industry bigger, from their respective
                homelands and while specializing in diverse cuisines. From Adriano Zumbo to Nigella Lawson and Luke
                Thomas to Sanjeev Kapoor, there is no dearth of chefs around the world who are all working towards a
                common aim with their signature white jackets and white hats—to promote the joy of cooking and serving
                others while consistently working towards building a bigger and a more passionate world for food</p>
